		content: '<p>In 1908, Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority became America&#39;s first Greek-letter organization established by Black college women. Her roots date back to Howard University, Washington, D.C., where the idea for formation was conceived by Ethel Hedgeman Lyle of St. Louis, Missouri.</p><p>After her incorporation as a perpetual body in 1913, Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority, Incorporated<sup>&reg;</sup>&nbsp;gradually branched out and became the channel through which selected college-trained women improved the socioeconomic conditions in their city, state, nation, and the world.</p><p>Alpha Mu Omega Chapter of Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority, Inc.<sup>&reg;</sup>, was founded February 16, 1929. Our chapter has a rich heritage of women making a difference in the Indianapolis community and internationally in Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority.</p><p>Mary A. Johnson, Dean of Girls at Crispus Attucks High School was the first President of Alpha Mu Omega Chapter and joining her as President were seven of our twenty-eight charter members: Eugenia D. Burbridge Asbury, Hattie Jones Edwards (who was also a National 1st Vice President), Thelma Frost Jackson, Ethel Kuykendall, Pauline Morton Finney, and Phyllis Wheatley Waters.<br><br>Other charter members were Hazel Alexander, Helen Hummons Anderson, Spaulding Pritchett Berry, Velma Pritchett Cage, Anna M. Hall Courtney, Iva Marshall Davis, Gladys Lucas Doyle, Selma Beck Harry, Ruth Haynes, Martha Horner, Fannie Hyde, Lillian Lemon, Henrietta Herod MacMillan, Edith Overton, Mercy Smith, Frances Stout, Lillian Taylor, Harriet Taylor, Murray Atkins Walls, A. Louise Moss Webb, and Lorene Cook Turner.</p><p>Currently over 440 Alpha Kappa Alpha women call Alpha Mu Omega their home chapter. Having an engaged membership of that size has helped us serve the Indianapolis community effectively for over 87 years. Our chapter membership represents every facet of the Indianapolis community - to name a few - we are educators, business women, lawyers, doctors, theologians and homemakers. Alpha Mu Omega is home to many Golden Members (between 50 &ndash; 74 years of service); historically had multiple Diamond Members (75+ years of service) in active membership; and is extremely proud of the diversity of current chapter membership. In addition to dedicated life-long members, we have members who are also newly initiated (1-3 years). This great diversity of our chapter helps to foster strong and sincere bonds of sisterhood.</p><p></p>'
